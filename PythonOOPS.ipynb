        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "*  Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data (objects), rather than functions and logic, where objects contain both data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is a class in OOP+\n",
        "*  In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, defining their attributes (data) and behaviors (methods). It's a user-defined data type that organizes information and enables code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP+\n",
        "*  In object-oriented programming (OOP), an object is a fundamental unit that encapsulates data (attributes or properties) and the actions (methods or functions) that can be performed on that data, representing a real-world entity or concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "*  Abstraction simplifies complex systems by hiding unnecessary details, focusing on essential functionalities, while encapsulation bundles data and methods into a single unit (like a class) and restricts direct access to protect data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "*  In Python, dunder methods are methods that allow instances of a class to interact with the built-in functions and operators of the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPH\n",
        "*  Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class. The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods. An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "*  In object-oriented programming (OOP), polymorphism means \"many forms\" and allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling code reusability and flexibility through shared interfaces and different implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "*  Encapsulation is achieved by declaring a class's data members and methods as either private or protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "*  In Python, a constructor is a special method, denoted by __init__, that initializes the attributes of a class when an object (instance) of that class is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "*  Class methods can access and modify class-level attributes. They have access to the class object and can modify class variables or create new instances of the class. Static methods, on the other hand, do not have access to the class object and cannot modify any class-level attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "* Method overloading means defining multiple methods within the same class that have the same name but different parameters (number or type).\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "*  Method overriding is a mechanism in OOP that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "*  The decorator is a built-in Python decorator that allows you to turn class methods into properties in a way that's both elegant and user-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "*  Polymorphism is crucial in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enables code reusability, flexibility, and extensibility by allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common interface, promoting modular and maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "*   An abstract class is a blueprint for other classes that cannot be instantiated directly and contains one or more abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "*  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers advantages like improved code organization, reusability, flexibility, and maintainability, making it a powerful tool for building complex and scalable software.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "*  A class variable (also known as a static variable) is shared by all instances (objects) of a class, while an instance variable is unique to each instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "*  In Python, multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class, enabling it to combine functionalities from multiple sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "*   __str__ provides a human-readable string representation of an object, primarily for display to users, while __repr__ offers a more detailed, developer-focused representation, often used for debugging and object inspection.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "*  The super() function allows a subclass to access and call methods and properties of its parent or superclass, facilitating inheritance and code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "*   the __del__() method, also known as a destructor or finalizer, is called when an object is about to be garbage collected, allowing for cleanup of resources before the object is destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "*  In Python, @classmethod binds a method to the class itself, receiving the class (cls) as the first argument, while @staticmethod binds a method to the class without any implicit arguments, making it suitable for utility functions within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "*  Polymorphism with inheritance is achieved through method overriding, where a child class redefines a method inherited from its parent class, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "*  Method chaining allows you to call multiple methods on the same object in a single line, where each method returns the object itself, enabling a fluent and readable code style.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "*  The purpose of the __call__ method in Python is to make an instance of a class callable, meaning you can call that instance like a function (e.g., instance())."
